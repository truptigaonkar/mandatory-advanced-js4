# CONNECT FOUR Game - Advanced JavaScript with React

## Instructions
* Connect Four is a game where two players take turns dropping colored discs into a 7x6 grid (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).
* The game should be implemented in React and the players drop discs into the columns by clicking on the grid. When a column is filled, it should not be possible to drop into that column again.
* A player wins when four discs of the same color are connected (vertically, horizontally or diagonally). It is important that the logic for checking the winner is implemented correctly.
* When a player wins, the game should display a message and it should not be possible to continue
playing. If the game is a draw, the game should show a message.
* A “reset” button should be displayed after the game is over.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:truptigaonkar/mandatory-advanced-js4.git
```
3. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
4. Start the project
```sh
npm start
```

### Requirements
* The game should be written using React
* The game should display a 7x6 grid of circles
* Dropping discs should be implemented correctly. It should not be possible to drop discs into a full column
* The logic to check if a player won should be implemented correctly
* The game should display messages when a player wins or the game is drawn
* The game should display a “reset” button when the game is over

### Tips
* Start by implementing the grid and the logic for dropping discs. The logic for deciding the winner can be implemented last
* Before implementing the logic to check who won, try creating an algorithm with pen and paper before writing any code
